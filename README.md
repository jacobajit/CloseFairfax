Crowdsourced snowday predictions

PROTOTYPE- BARELY FUNCTIONAL

Harnesses intelligence of the public based on the idea that "the crowd is never wrong." Enables integration of local insight based on past events, mood, and other intuitive factors that are neglected by automated snowday calculators. Votes are weighted based on previous accuracy of predictions, ensuring that consistently correct predictors are given more value. Leaderboards display current rankings of accuracy.
